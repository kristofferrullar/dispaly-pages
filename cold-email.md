# Cold Email – Learning Workflow

---

## Purpose

This cold email workflow is a **learning task**, not a scaling channel.

Its goals are to:
- understand relevance
- practice human email writing
- learn deliverability basics
- build intuition safely

Cold email is treated as **one-to-one outreach**, not marketing.

---

## Core Rule

**If it looks automated or pushy, it fails.**

---

## Infrastructure Rules

- Separate domain from promotions
- One mailbox
- Real name and signature
- Plain text only
- No images
- No tracking pixels
- No links in the first email

---

## Daily Workflow

1. Select a very small number of recipients
2. Confirm relevance for each person
3. Write a short, human email
4. Send manually or with strict limits
5. Wait for replies
6. Stop immediately if signals are negative

---

## Email Structure

- 5–7 lines
- One idea
- One question
- No selling
- No urgency

Tone example (logic, not copy):

“Quick question about X.  
Not sure if this is relevant.  
Happy to leave you alone if not.”

---

## Success Criteria

- Replies = success
- Neutral replies count
- Silence is normal
- Complaints are failure

No replies → adjust or stop  
Replies → continue slowly

---

## Volume Rules

- Start at 5–10 emails/day
- Increase only after positive replies
- Never rush
- Never batch hundreds

---

## Cleaning Rules

- Any “no” → never email again
- Any complaint → stop immediately
- Silence after one follow-up → stop
- No chasing

---

## Relationship to Main Workflow

Promotional workflow:
- list-based
- behavior escalation
- structured cadence

Cold email:
- individual-based
- relevance-driven
- no escalation

They are intentionally separate.

## One-Sentence Summary

“Cold email is slow, personal outreach where replies matter more than volume.”
